Network
Networking is everything today, companies are buying more from fewer partners. We are not getting along just by ourselves any more. Among many other things, networks are needed for better service portfolio, lowering business risks and increased customer experience. Individuals or a single company usually cannot provide all the skills and resources needed to maintain the market position and grow the business at the same time. To grow the business needs usually new thinking, new talents, more time and money â€“ why would you do that all by yourself.    
Anbrella forms a virtual group of companies giving larger offering, more resources, access to bigger companies and lower business risk. Anbrella provides most of the services that companies would need to recruit or hire for themselves to turn their business into next gear.
We wish you all warmly join the Anbrella network.
